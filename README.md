# Full Efficiency Prediction
To predict fuel efficiency, I aim to predict a continuous value output, such as a price or a probability.

**About the Dataset -**

I will be using the classic [Auto MPG](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/9/auto+mpg) Dataset and builds a model to predict the fuel efficiency of the late-1970s and early 1980s automobiles. To do this, weâ€™ll provide the model with a description of many automobiles from that time period. This description includes attributes like cylinders, displacement, horsepower, and weight.

The dataset is available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/).
